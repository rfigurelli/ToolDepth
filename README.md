## Executive Summary

Current intelligence assessments in biological and artificial domains rely on coarse, binary markers of tool use—simply whether an agent uses tools or not. This method overlooks the nuanced, multi-layered processes that distinguish mere tool use from deeply recursive tool-making and fails to capture incremental advances in cognitive and engineering sophistication.

**Innovation of ToolDepth:** ToolDepth introduces the concept of **Recursive Instrumental Index (RII),** a metric that quantifies the number of sequential tool-production layers. Each layer represents a tool employed to create the next, forming a chain whose depth correlates with strategic planning, foresight, and adaptive learning. By focusing on lineage rather than end results, RII reveals hidden dimensions of intelligence.

**Relevance to AGI Research:** The pursuit of artificial general intelligence hinges on systems that autonomously plan, design, and refine tools or subroutines across multiple stages. ToolDepth provides:

* **AGI Progress Benchmarks:** RII thresholds define milestones toward AGI, marking when an AI system achieves truly recursive self-improvement capabilities.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Real-time RII monitoring can signal emergent AGI-like behavior when depth indices exceed expected human benchmarks.
* **Cross-Domain Validation:** By comparing AI RII scores against anthropological and ethological data, researchers can contextualize AI developments within natural intelligence evolution.

**Key Contributions:**

* **Granular Depth Measurement:** Integer-based RII scores expose incremental improvements in AI architectures and learning algorithms.
* **Unified Comparative Framework:** Directly aligns machine capabilities with biological tool-use evolution, fostering interdisciplinary insights.
* **Operational Transparency:** Dependency graphs trace each recursion step, facilitating explainability and auditability in AGI systems.

This white paper elaborates on:

1. **Hierarchical Classification (Classes 0–12):** Taxonomy of tool-making depth across species and machines.
2. **RII Computation:** Algorithms for extracting and scoring dependency graphs from logs and observations.
3. **Data Infrastructure:** End-to-end pipeline for ingestion, processing, storage, and visualization.
4. **Use Cases:** Strategic applications in anthropology, AI benchmarking, education, and industrial innovation.
5. **Future Directions:** Embodied AI integration, AGI detection via RII anomalies, and planetary-scale recursive modeling.

By shifting focus from tool use to tool-making depth, ToolDepth equips AGI research with precise metrics and scientific rigor, accelerating the path toward truly autonomous, self-improving systems.
